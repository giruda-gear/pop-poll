# Monorepo Project

This repository is a monorepo setup using Nx with multiple apps and libs

## Project Structure

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web/client/ (Next.js)
â””â”€â”€ libs/
    â””â”€â”€ database/ (MikroORM)

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Nx** â€” Monorepo build and task runner  
- **NestJS** â€” Backend framework  
- **MikroORM** â€” TypeScript ORM with PostgreSQL  
- **TypeScript** â€” Main language with `CommonJS` module system for compatibility  
- **pnpm** â€” Package manager  

## Setup & Usage

1. Install workspace dependencies:  
```bash
   pnpm install -w
```
2. Launch PostgreSQL and Redis with Docker Compose:
```bash
    docker compose up -d
```
3.	Run application in development mode with Nx
```bash
    nx serve poll
    nx serve client
```

4.	Configure environment variables (e.g., .env file).


## Notes

- CommonJS module system was chosen for compatibility with NestJS and MikroORM decorators.
- MikroORM entities are compiled into `dist/libs/database/src/entities`.
- The `temp/` folder contains MikroORM metadata cache files and should be ignored by Git.
- Nx caching can be skipped with the `--skip-nx-cache` flag during commands.
- Path mapping (`@database`) is used for cleaner imports.


## Troubleshooting

- **No entities were discovered error**:  
  Ensure that the compiled `.js` files for entities exist under the correct `dist` path specified in `mikro-orm.config.ts`. Also, verify `entities` and `entitiesTs` paths in the config.

- **MikroORM decorator metadata issues**:  
  Use `"module": "CommonJS"` and enable `"emitDecoratorMetadata": true` and `"experimentalDecorators": true` in `tsconfig.json`.

- **Nx caching issues**:  
  Use `nx reset` or add `--skip-nx-cache` flag to bypass cached outputs during development.

- **When to Use Webpack:**
  - Use webpack to bundle code for smaller deploy size and faster startup in serverless environments.
  - For local or traditional servers, `tsc` compile-only is sufficient and faster.
  - To enable webpack, set the build executor to `@nx/webpack:webpack` with a proper `webpack.config.js`.
